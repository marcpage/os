# A collection of inline classes that make os interaction easier in C++
#
# This file is a bash script that generates the documentation and runs the test suites.
# Performance tests are only meant to be compared on the same machine during the same session
# 	for when making changes to code for performance. Run the tests multiple times
# 	before the change, recording results, and then after to see if and how much
# 	your changes affected performance.

# Run this script via:
# bash -e README
