# os
## A collection of inline classes that make os interaction easier in C++

Running 'make' generates the documentation and runs the test suites. Performance tests are only meant to be compared on the same machine during the same session for when making changes to code for performance. Run the tests multiple times before the change, recording results, and then after to see if and how much your changes affected performance.

# testing
Just run 'make'

# TODO
Need to add tests for AsymetricEncrypt and MemoryMappedFile
Need to remove Buffer*.h and update Socket code and tests to just use std::string
